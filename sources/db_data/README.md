# Data collector's database file directory

## What?
This directory is used to store the `db.sqlite3` file,
which is used by the [ingest_data](../ingest/management/commands/ingest_data.py)
management command as temporary storage.

The `db.sqlite3` file itself is not, and should not, be committed to the repository,
as it is temporary and will be generated by the `ingest_data` command.

## Why?

Having this directory in the repository helps compatibility with running
the data collector in a virtual environment (e.g. using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)),
where [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) and [compose.yaml](../../compose.yaml) files have no effect.
